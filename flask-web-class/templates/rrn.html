    <p class="main-content">Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of
        artificial neural
        networks designed for sequential data processing and prediction. Unlike
        traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form
        directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a memory of previous inputs
        in their internal state. This memory enables RNNs to capture temporal
        dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making them well-suited
        for tasks such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and
        time series analysis.

        The key feature of RNNs is their ability to process sequences of inputs,
        where each input is not only influenced by the current input but also by
        the information stored in the network's internal memory from previous
        inputs. This makes RNNs particularly effective in tasks where context
        and order matter.

        However, traditional RNNs have limitations in capturing long-term
        dependencies due to issues like vanishing and exploding gradients. To
        address these problems, more advanced RNN architectures, such as Long
        Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
        networks, have been developed. These architectures include mechanisms
        that help the network better manage and retain information over longer
        sequences, improving their performance on tasks requiring the modeling
        of long-range dependencies.

        In summary, RNNs are a powerful class of neural networks that excel at
        processing sequential data, making them valuable in various applications
        where understanding and utilizing temporal patterns are essential.</p>
