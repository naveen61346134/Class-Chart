<div class="main-content">
    <p>Prompt engineering is a strategic approach in natural language processing
        (NLP) and machine learning where careful design and formulation of input
        prompts or queries are used to guide models in generating specific and
        desired outputs. In tasks such as language generation, text completion,
        or question answering, the choice of words, structure, and context in a
        prompt significantly influences the response from the model. Engineers
        and researchers use prompt engineering to fine-tune the input so that
        the model produces accurate, contextually appropriate, and relevant
        results. It involves understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses
        and crafting prompts to leverage its capabilities effectively.
        Successful prompt engineering can enhance the performance of language
        models and improve their responsiveness to user queries or commands.</p>
